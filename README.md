# VINDRIKTNING ESP32

## About this project

This project takes [Ikea VINDRIKTNING air dust sensor](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/vindriktning-luftqualitaetssensor-70498242/)
in combination with [LaskaKit ESP-VINDRIKTNING ESP-32 I2C](https://github.com/LaskaKit/ESP-Vindriktning), adds
several sensors such as [SCD41](https://www.laskakit.cz/laskakit-scd41-senzor-co2--teploty-a-vlhkosti-vzduchu/) and
[DHT22 (optional)](https://www.laskakit.cz/arduino-senzor-teploty-a-vlhkosti-vzduchu-dht22/) or
[SHT40 (optional)](https://www.laskakit.cz/laskakit-sht40-senzor-teploty-a-vlhkosti-vzduchu/) for full measuring of air quality.

## Hardware

Used hardware is mentioned above. This combination of HW sensors allows to measure following parameters:

- Amount of C02 in ppm in the air (by `SCD41`)
- Amount of dust in ug/m3 in the air (by `PM1006K`)
- Air temperature (by `SCD41` or `DHT22` or `SHT40`)
- Air humidity (by `SCD41` or `DHT22` or `SHT40`)
- Ambient light amount (by internal phototransistor)

As an output the 3 RGB led diodes are used. Also [buzzer](https://www.laskakit.cz/pasivni-bzucak--5v/)
with switching transistor can be attached to alert you when air quality getting low and your room needs
to be ventilated.

## Software

As base software platform have been used [Micropython](https://micropython.org/), as it is relatively robust, lean and
easy to develop. It also allow to easily adds custom plugins in the case of need. Whole system is written using `asyncio`
based cooperative scheduling. This concept allows following:

- Written software based on `asyncio` cooperative scheduling (multiple simultneouisly running tasks)
- Simple plugins framework (each plugin gets its own task)
- Access to sensors and dispatching it's values to plugins (tasks refreshing sensors states)
- Easy configuration based on configuration `json` files (default variants are created autoamtically when they are not present).
- Power management handling (prevent heating of processor by periodically falling to light sleep mode).
- Automatic LED intensity based on surrounding light amount and olor transition control (transition tasks).
- Access to WiFi networking (network management task allowing to connect e.g. to `MQTT`).

By default there are following built-in plugins:

- `sensor_to_led` used to set LED diodes according to current sensors state (CO2 and dust - enabled by default).
- `sensor_to_mqtt` used to send sensors values to [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) broker so they can be later processed e.g. by [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or another MQTT client.
- `co2_alert` alerts you when CO2 amount in room reaches above certain limit.

### Micropython

#### Install

1. Download and install [python](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) by command `pip install esptool`.
3. Download [precompiled Micropython firmware from this repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ondiiik/vindriktning-mpy/main/mpy/fw/esp32-vindriktning-mpy.bin).
4. Erase chip by following command `esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash` (choose port where your device is connected - `COM`*n* on Windows)
5. Flash downloaded firmware by command `esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-vindriktning-mpy.bin`

When all steps above succeeded, you can switch the device on. All python files are already built-in as frozen modules
and device shall start immediatelly. All configuration files are created when device boot up.

#### Additional tweaking

For additional tweaking we needs some UART terminal with capability to edit configuration files. We can use
[Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) for this purposes. To install this IDE we can use command `pip install thonny`.
After that you can type `thonny` in your terminal and run it.

![Thonny](doc/thonny1.png)

First of all we need to set-up IDE to be attached to micropython device. To do that go into
`Tools -> Options... -> Interpreter` and choose `Micropython (ESP32)` and port where is ESP connected.

![Thonny](doc/thonny2.png)

Once interpreter is set up, then click on `Stop/Start backend` button (or press `CTRL` + `F2`).

![Thonny](doc/thonny3.png)

Then you shall be able to see python repl prompt and files stored in device.

![Thonny](doc/thonny4.png)

### Configuration

Once we have file system accesible via [thonny](https://thonny.org/), we can edit any of created `json` files.
Files are created by default with description so it shall be obvious what, whyv and how it can be changed.
You can now set-up e.g. WiFi connection, enable some defaultly disabled plugins or set their parameters.

### Plugins

Software is written to support core user functionality by plugins. This plugins are loaded automatically from folder
`plugins`. There are several plugins already present po provide some basic functionality or as some examples
for those who wants to write his own.

#### `sensor_to_led`

This plugin handles LED colors according to sensors values. Especially CO2 (top LED) and dust (bottom LED) sensor.
Colors are signalizing smoothly from green (good conditions), over blue (normal conditions) to red (bad conditions).

![RGB](doc/led1.png)

#### `sensor_to_mqtt`

This plugin provides sensors data to MQTT broker so anyone can use them. When plugin starts, it prints
on UART template of settings for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) so you add them to you HA
and can see them as regular sensors. Just note that this template is printed in debug mode only (file `cfg/logging.json`)

#### `co2_alert`

This plugin activates alarm on built in buzzer when CO2 level exceedes certain value to notify
that is time to open window and make air more fresh.

### Advices

#### Measuring with `SCD41`

Sensor `SCD41` does great job and measures relatively precisely. But this is true only in certain conditions.
Output of this sensor depends on how this sensor is mounted into the device. Measurement can be negatively
affected by external vibration or heating or cooling. This can be in small space like VINDRIKTNING box especialy
when ESP32 chip produces some heat and when area is even ventilated by `PM1006K` a bit problem. This is main reason
why some kind of power management was implemented in this software. However to add additional molytan isolation
around sensor would help. Be sure to keep side of sensor pointing out of the box uncovered to keep access to the
outer air. To use some rubber mount dumpers would be good idea as well as there may be vibrations from `PM1006K`
ventilator.

#### Measuring with `DHT21` or `SHT40`

I tried to add also `DHT21` and `SHT40` as I was unsure about precision of measuring humidity and temperature by
`SCD41`. However after some time I found that `SCD41` gets values reliable enough, so this additional sensors are
not really necessary unless you want to have precise measuring.
